Let's put this simply. The makers of this software (RemoteShellServer and RemoteShellClient) are NOT liable for any damage caused by this program. You (the user) are. We warn you that the data is unencrypted, and can be modified by hackers. When used correctly, this is a great tool. Please do not distribute the software you download, and instead give others the link to the latest release here on github.
